The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations\nparticipating.[3] The Olympic Games are normally held every four years, alternating between the Summer and Winter Games\nevery two years in the four-year period.\nTheir creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games (Ancient Greek: Ὀλυμπιακοί Ἀγῶνες), which were held in Olympia, \nGreece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic\nCommittee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic\nMovement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.\nThe evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic\nGames. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic \nGames for athletes with a disability, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental games \n(Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic\nGames. The Deaflympics and Special Olympics are also endorsed by the IOC. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic,\npolitical, and technological advancements. The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc nations prompted the IOC to shift\naway from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes. The growing\nimportance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialisation of the Games. \nWorld wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large-scale boycotts during the Cold War limited \nparticipation in the 1980 and 1984 Games,[4] and the 2020 Games were postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\"\"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#tokenatization in sentences\nsentence = nltk.sent_tokenize(para)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#tokenatization in words\nword = nltk.word_tokenize(para)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
